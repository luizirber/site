<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Software Architect and Developer</strong> with a track record of building systems that allows people to focus on their areas of expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>First I built systems to help people focus on their areas of expertise. Now I want to help them to do things they didn’t even know were possible, while at the same time training them on the basic skills they need to be computationally literate.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Experience with the design and development of desktop, client-server, mobile and scientific software applications. Recent projects were mostly in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>, but languages used proficiently in the past include <strong>C, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Fortran</strong>.</p>
<p>Worked with several development platforms/libraries (such as <strong>Cocoa</strong>, <strong>Maemo</strong>, and <strong>Cray supercomputers</strong>), tools and frameworks (e.g. <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>) working on <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Mac OS X</strong> and also <strong>iOS</strong>.</p>
<p>Strong knowledge of <strong>scientific programming</strong>, web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), algorithms, data structures and other concepts and paradigms relevant to software development.</p></li>

<h2 id="professional-history">Professional History</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>From June to September 2016 I worked as a summer intern in software engineering of the Metagenomics Computation and Analytics Workbench (MCAW) project at the Industrial and Applied Genomics Group of the Accelerated Discovery Lab at IBM Research. MCAW is the main informatics platform used in the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/client-programs/foodsafety/"><strong>Sequencing the Food Supply Chain Consortium</strong></a>. It is a compute cluster and web application that enables the management and analysis of DNA and RNA sequence data using extensive bioinformatics methods.</p>
Projects included:
<ul>
<li>Scale-out bioinformatics using <a href="https://spark.apache.org"><strong>Apache Spark</strong></a></li>
<li>Capability extension using <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Mesos</strong></li>
<li>Advanced visualization of genomic data and statistical analysis results (in Python and R)</li>
<li>Experimentation with novel bioinformatics methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Since September 2015 I’m continuing my Ph.D degree at University of California, Davis, working as a Graduate Student Researcher at the <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org"><strong>Lab for Data Intensive Biology</strong></a> under <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/"><strong>Dr. C Titus Brown</strong></a> orientation. I’m focusing my research on <strong>sketches</strong>, <strong>streaming</strong> and <strong>online</strong> approaches for biological data analysis. I also joined the <a href="http://deb.ucdavis.edu/"><strong>Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology</strong></a> (DEB) program on February 2016.</p>
<p>From January 2014 to August 2015 I was a Ph.D student at Michigan State University, working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="http://ged.msu.edu"><strong>Laboratory of Genomics, Evolution and Development</strong></a> under <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/"><strong>Dr. C Titus Brown</strong></a> orientation. I developed the <a href="https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer"><strong><strong>k</strong>-mer cardinality estimation</strong></a> functionality on the lab software package, <a href="https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/pull/257"><strong>khmer</strong></a>, in addition to being a primary code reviewer.</p>
<p>From September 2013 to December 2013 I worked in the Sync API team at <a href="http://www.titansgroup.com.br"><strong>Titans Group</strong></a>. Sync is a whitelabel product for files and contacts synchronization and base to Titans’ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130731225430/http://titansgroup.com.br/cloud.php"><strong>Personal Cloud</strong></a>. In the API team we develop the backend used by all our clients (Web, iOS, Android, Windows, OS X) and the Web client, the reference implementation.</p>
<p>From December 2010 to April 2013 I worked at the Brazilian <a href="http://gmao.ccst.inpe.br/"><strong>National Institute for Space Research</strong></a>, developing tools for a coupled general circulation model. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/luizirber/bosun"><strong>Bosun</strong></a>, a runtime environment. It is used to <strong>document</strong> and <strong>automate</strong> the tasks related to running a <strong>climate model</strong> (prepare inputs, compile the code, run the model, archive the results). It is based on <a href="http://fabfile.org"><strong>Fabric</strong></a> and can be used as a library or CLI.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/luizirber/thalassa"><strong>Thalassa</strong></a>, an ocean grid editing application.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting up a <strong>Jenkins</strong> server to do <strong>continuous integration</strong> of the codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining an <a href="http://hpcugent.github.io/easybuild/"><strong>EasyBuild</strong></a> installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Help with the data analysis, using the <strong>SciPy</strong> stack and other softwares like <strong>Ferret</strong> and <strong>GrADS</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Operationalization of the model for <strong>seasonal climate forecasts</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Python training for researchers, including setting up <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong> and <strong>parallel clusters</strong> on the supercomputer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From September 2008 to July 2009 I worked at <a href="http://www.pinutsstudios.com.br"><strong>Pinuts Studios</strong></a>, a mobile development company. At first I worked on a prototype for a <strong>Maemo</strong> application, and after that in their first <strong>iOS app</strong>.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2007 I worked at <a href="http://www.cnpdia.embrapa.br/"><strong>Embrapa Instrumentação Agropecuária</strong></a> developing a <a href="http://github.com/luizirber/bugbrother"><strong>video tracking application for statistical analysis of animal behavior</strong></a>. More specifically, the research was done to study the effects of pheromone traps on insects, which would avoid the use of chemical pesticides and their impact on nature. It was implemented in <strong>Python</strong>, using <strong>GStreamer</strong> for video manipulation and <strong>PyGTK</strong> for UI.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source-projects-and-other-activities">Open-Source Projects and Other Activities</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>During the 30 hours of the first OLPC Game Jam Brasil, in 2007, I co-developed a game called <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Gambiarra"><strong>Gambiarra</strong></a> (it means ‘Workaround’ in portuguese). It was written in <strong>Python</strong>, using <strong>PyGame</strong>.</p>
<p>Since 2012 I’’m developing with <a href="http://ciclotux.blogspot.com.br">Arnaldo Russo</a> a <strong>sonification</strong> tool for scientific data called <a href="http://github.com/arnaldorusso/oceansound"><strong>OceanSound</strong></a>. We presented it as a poster during the <strong>Brazilian Oceanographic Conference</strong>. Our session in the conference caught the attention of many participants, which praised our work and contributed with new approaches and data to analyze. An updated version was presented at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/201/"><strong>PyCon 2013</strong></a> and there is a <a href="http://ocean.datasounds.org"><strong>live demo</strong></a> available.</p>
<p>Spoke in conferences like <strong>FISL</strong> and <strong>PythonBrasil</strong>, and also in events at universities such as <strong>UFSCar</strong> and <strong>Uniara</strong>. Topics included <strong>image processing</strong>, <strong>game development</strong>, <strong>HPC</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>Non-development activities includes adapting Monty Python sketches to Portuguese and presenting them in <strong>PythonBrasil</strong> as lightning talks, including a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQxjlGIz2ww">sketch about programming languages based on the Spanish Inquisition</a>. Besides acting, I made a short movie called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlBgtjeNt0">Salad</a> and I also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg2FgY8HL5I">play guitar</a>. Usually my partner in crime in these art attempts is <a href="https://github.com/gabrielmarcondes">Gabriel Marcondes</a>.</p>
